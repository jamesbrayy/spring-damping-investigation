\noindent This investigation examines the effect of attached mass and spring configuration on the damping rate of a vertically oscillating mass-spring system. Displacement--time data was collected for varying load masses and spring arrangements to determine the decay constant $\gamma$ and damped angular frequency $\omega'$. Results showed that $\gamma$ decreased with increasing mass, consistent with an inverse proportionality to $m_{\text{load}}$, while spring configuration indirectly produced small but measurable variations in damping, likely due to internal friction and alignment differences in the experimental setup. These findings provide empirical validation of theoretical damped harmonic motion models and highlight the strong interdependence of parameters in mechanical systems.
